# Evaluating Zohran Mamdani’s Policy Agenda and Budget Feasibility

Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist and recently elected mayor of New York City (taking office in January 2026), ran on an ambitious affordability platform. His proposals range from big-ticket public programs (e.g. free transit, universal childcare, massive housing construction) to regulatory changes (e.g. rent freezes, wage laws) intended to make NYC more livable. Below we outline Mamdani’s major policy proposals – divided into those requiring significant city spending and those that are primarily regulatory – and then discuss how to analyze whether the city can afford these policies using a Monte Carlo budget simulation.

### Budgetary/Spending Policy Proposals

These initiatives would require substantial public funding or re-allocation of the city budget:

- **Fare-Free, Faster Buses:** Mamdani plans to eliminate bus fares citywide and improve bus service speed. The campaign estimates this “free buses” initiative will cost about \$700 million per year (after accounting for fare evasion) ￼. This could be covered by reprioritizing within NYC’s enormous budget (over $116 billion annually) ￼ or via new revenues. 
- **Universal Childcare:** A cornerstone of Mamdani’s agenda is to provide no-cost childcare for all NYC families. This would create a city-funded universal childcare system covering infants and toddlers (expanding on existing pre-K). Estimated costs vary widely: roughly \$6–10 billion per year once fully implemented, depending on worker pay levels and program scope (one analysis put it at ~$9.5 billion if childcare workers are paid a living wage, and even higher if pay is on par with public school teachers). Mamdani acknowledges this hinges on new funding (a tax increase needing state approval), but it’s extremely popular and could yield long-term economic benefits by boosting labor force participation.
- **Mass Affordable Housing Construction:** To tackle NYC’s housing crisis, Mamdani proposes building 200,000 new affordable housing units over 10 years. This ambitious plan would require about $100 billion in investment. Rather than spending it all at once, the idea is to finance construction in phases through municipal bonds (debt) and potentially private partnerships. Crucially, these units wouldn’t be free housing – they’d charge affordable rents that help service the debt over time. In other words, the city might borrow, say, ~\$10 billion per year for housing, and the resulting rental income plus future budgets would pay that down in tranches rather than burdening one year’s budget ￼. This spreads out the cost, though it still represents a major long-term fiscal commitment.
- **City-Owned Grocery Stores:** To combat rising food costs, Mamdani plans to pilot municipally-owned grocery stores in “food desert” neighborhoods. The initial proposal is five city-run grocery stores with an estimated startup cost of about \$60 million. The city would subsidize these stores by covering rent and property taxes to keep prices low. While a $60 million pilot is modest in the context of NYC’s budget, scaling this program citywide would require greater ongoing subsidies (for rent, operations, etc.), which must be budgeted.
- **“Baby Baskets” for Newborns:** Inspired by Finland’s baby box program, Mamdani plans to give free “baby baskets” to every new parent in NYC. These care packages would include essentials for newborns – diapers, wipes, nursing and postpartum supplies, baby clothes, books, and information on city resources – at no cost to families. While not extremely expensive per family, with ~100,000 births in NYC per year this could cost on the order of tens of millions annually (e.g. 100k baskets * ~\$500 each = \$50 million). The goal is to support new parents and show visible benefits of city government.
- **“Green Schools” Climate Initiative:** Mamdani’s climate agenda includes “Green Schools for a Healthier NY” – likely a program to retrofit school buildings with green infrastructure (solar panels, energy-efficient upgrades, better ventilation, etc.). This would involve capital spending on school facilities. Detailed costs are not yet published, but such retrofits could run in the hundreds of millions spread over years. This is a capital investment that could potentially be funded via the city’s capital budget (bonds) similar to other infrastructure.
- **Department of Community Safety:** In lieu of relying solely on traditional policing, Mamdani campaigned on creating a new Department of Community Safety to handle non-violent emergencies and invest in prevention. This restructuring would entail hiring social workers, mental health responders, violence interrupters, and other personnel – effectively a parallel public safety approach. Initial costs might be offset by redirecting some of the NYPD’s ~$11 billion budget ￼. However, setting up the department will require funding for staff, training, and administration. We might expect on the order of a few hundred million dollars in new annual spending here (assuming funds reallocated from police for equivalent roles).
- **Libraries and Other Services:** Mamdani also emphasizes fully funding public libraries and other social services. This could mean expanding library hours and programs, which might require modest budget increases (NYPL and other libraries are a tiny fraction of the budget). Similarly, strengthening NYC’s public healthcare system (NYC Health + Hospitals) and other community services may require additional funding, though specific dollar pledges were not highlighted in campaign materials.
- **Funding the Agenda – New Revenue:** To pay for these programs, Mamdani’s plan is to generate new revenue primarily by raising taxes on corporations and the wealthy. His campaign projects about \$10 billion per year in additional revenue from these measures. This includes a hike in the state corporate profits tax (from 7.25% to 11.5%) yielding roughly \$5 billion (much of which would be shared with NYC), and a 2% city income tax surcharge on millionaires yielding roughly \$4 billion. These tax changes require approval in Albany (the state legislature), but if enacted they would expand NYC’s budget capacity by roughly 8–10%. Mamdani also intends to improve collection of existing taxes/fees and trim lower-priority expenditures, which could free up some funds. For our analysis, this $9–10 billion figure is crucial – it represents the budget headroom for new spending if his revenue proposals succeed.

### Regulatory and Non-Spending Policy Proposals

These initiatives focus on laws, regulations, or executive actions rather than direct spending. They aim to make life more affordable or fair without large budget outlays:
- **Rent Freeze for Stabilized Apartments:** On day one, Mamdani vows to freeze rents for all tenants in rent-stabilized units. This would halt annual rent increases on over 1 million regulated apartments. Importantly, a rent freeze “is nearly free” in budget terms ￼ – it’s a regulatory decision (by the Rent Guidelines Board, which the mayor influences) rather than a program that costs city money. The benefit is preventing additional housing costs for tenants, though landlords argue it shifts costs onto them. (There might be minor administrative costs to implement and defend the policy, but no major budget line item.)
- **Strengthening Tenant Protections:** Beyond the freeze, Mamdani wants to crack down on bad landlords and end deed theft scams. This means stricter enforcement of housing codes and aggressive legal action against landlords who harass or illegally evict tenants. The city can do this through its existing housing agencies (e.g. HPD) and legal departments; it might involve hiring more inspectors or attorneys (relatively low cost). Supporting homeowners against deed theft likely involves legal aid programs and outreach (again a modest expense). These measures are more about regulation and enforcement – high impact on bad actors, low direct cost to the city.
- **Rising the Minimum Wage to \$30/hour:** Mamdani’s labor platform includes pushing to raise NYC’s minimum wage to $30 by 2030. While the city cannot unilaterally raise the private-sector minimum wage above the state level without Albany’s approval, the mayor can lobby for state legislation or set higher wages for city employees and contractors. This policy does not require city budget spending for subsidies – it mandates higher pay by employers. (It could indirectly increase the city’s own payroll costs for municipal workers and contracted staff, but those increases would be phased in and could be planned for in future budgets.) Overall, it’s a regulatory/economic policy aimed at boosting incomes, not a program that the city “pays for” out of the budget.
- **Regulating the Gig Economy (Delivery Apps):** The agenda includes regulating app-based delivery services and improving conditions for delivery workers. NYC has already passed minimum pay standards for food delivery workers; Mamdani would continue bolstering such protections. These are regulatory actions (e.g. enforcing wage floors, safety requirements, limiting fees apps can charge restaurants) with minimal budget impact aside from enforcement. The goal is to protect gig workers’ pay and rights without direct spending.
- **“Fighting Corporate Exploitation”:** This broad theme includes using every tool of city government to curb price gouging and corporate greed that harm consumers. For example, the city can direct its Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (DCWP) to investigate price gouging and deceptive business practices. Under existing laws, DCWP can subpoena businesses and impose fines for unfair pricing ￼. Mamdani could also declare emergencies (e.g. citing skyrocketing food prices) to invoke anti-price-gouging rules. These actions don’t require new funding, just political will and legal strategy. He could even create an “Affordability War Room” or deputy mayor for affordability to coordinate efforts across agencies. All these steps are about enforcing rules to lower costs – essentially regulatory moves that cost little but could save residents money.
- **LGBTQIA+ Protections:** Mamdani’s platform commits to strengthening protections for LGBTQIA+ New Yorkers ￼. This likely involves enforcing anti-discrimination laws, supporting queer youth services, and safeguarding healthcare rights. While the city might increase funding for LGBTQ+ community programs or homeless youth shelters (small budget items), much of this agenda is about policy stance – ensuring NYC remains a safe haven with strong human rights laws. Budget impact would be minimal or folded into existing agency work.
- **“Trump-Proofing” NYC:** Given the hostile stance of the Trump administration (as of 2025) toward progressive cities, Mamdani has pledged to **“Trump-proof” New York City ￼. This means resisting federal attacks – for instance, refusing to cooperate with federal immigration dragnets (sanctuary city policies), filling budget gaps if D.C. pulls funding, and legally challenging harmful federal actions. While largely a defensive policy posture, the city may set aside reserve funds to cushion against federal funding cuts and spend on legal challenges or immigrant services if federal support is withdrawn. The Guardian notes Trump is expected to try to “sabotage” NYC by cutting funds ￼, so part of Trump-proofing may involve creating contingency budgets. In general, though, this is more about policy and smart budgeting rather than new programs with defined costs.
- **Small Business Support:** Although less fleshed out in headlines, Mamdani has indicated he will assist small businesses. This could involve reducing onerous fines/fees, streamlining permits, providing low-interest loans or grants, and possibly establishing a public bank for NYC. Many of these steps are regulatory or one-time initiatives that don’t require massive spending. For example, cutting red tape or lowering fines might reduce city revenue slightly, but can be seen as a policy cost. Any grant or loan program for small businesses would be a budget item but likely modest compared to the big social programs. We will treat small-business relief as a minor factor in the fiscal analysis (unless a specific expensive program is proposed).

In summary, Mamdani’s regulatory agenda – rent freezes, wage laws, consumer protection, civil rights, etc. – aims to deliver relief without heavily drawing on the city’s coffers. These measures are important for affordability but don’t figure prominently in a budget simulation except to note any small implementation costs.

## Methodology: Testing Affordability with a Monte Carlo Simulation

To predict whether NYC can afford Mamdani’s agenda, we will construct a quantitative model of the city’s budget under these proposals. The core idea is to simulate many scenarios of program costs versus available revenue, given the inherent uncertainties. The steps are as follows:

1. **Define the Budget Constraint (Threshold):** We need a clear threshold for what “affordable” means in dollar terms. NYC must legally balance its budget each year, so new spending must be covered by either new revenues or cuts. Based on Mamdani’s plan, we’ll assume roughly \$10 billion per year is available for his initiatives if his tax proposals pass ￼. (This comes from ~\$5B via higher corporate taxes and ~\$4B via a millionaire’s tax, plus some improved collections ￼ ￼.) We might also include, say, \$1 billion from internal savings/reallocations (for instance, trimming other programs or using some of the city’s natural revenue growth ￼). In total, our model might set a budget threshold of about $10–11 billion in new annual spending that can be sustained without deficits. If the total cost of all proposals exceeds this threshold in a given simulation run, we’d consider that scenario “not affordable” (meaning the budget wouldn’t balance without additional measures).

2. **Gather Cost Estimates for Each Policy:** Using research and available analyses, we will assign an estimated annual cost to each major spending proposal:
   - Free Buses: ~\$0.7 billion per year ￼.
   - Universal Childcare: We might use a midpoint like ~\$8 billion/year (within the \$6–12B range) as the expected cost ￼.
   - Affordable Housing Plan: This one is tricky – \$100B over 10 years. Rather than drop \$10B/year into our operating budget, we’ll model the annual debt service or subsidy cost. For example, if half the cost is financed by city bonds and half by external/private funds, the city might issue \$50B in bonds. Annual debt service on that (assume 4–5% interest, 30-year amortization) could be on the order of \$3–4 billion per year in the long run. However, in early years the city might only be servicing a portion (since debt is issued gradually). Also, rent from the new housing will offset some costs. For simplicity, we could start with an annual net cost of about $2 billion to the city for the housing program (acknowledging that actual financing is complex). We will test different assumptions in the simulation (perhaps treating this cost as uncertain and potentially higher or lower).
   - City Grocery Stores: \$60 million for 5 stores pilot. If the plan is to expand to, say, 20 stores eventually, that could be ~\$240M one-time. There might also be ongoing subsidies (covering rent/tax as per the model). We’ll treat $60 million/year as an initial cost (this covers either continuous pilot operations or annualized expansion cost).
   - Baby Baskets: Using the rough calculation above, assume $50 million per year.
   - Green Schools Initiative: This might be a capital program where spending varies by year. We can assume an average $100 million per year on green retrofits (some years more, some less). It’s relatively small compared to others.
   - Community Safety Dept: Suppose the city shifts \$200M from NYPD to the new department and adds an extra \$100 million to beef up services. Net new cost ~$100M/year (assuming much of the budget comes from reallocations).
   - Libraries and Other: Maybe an extra $50 million/year for libraries and various social programs to “keep them whole.”

These are ballpark mean estimates. We will tabulate each policy with its expected annual cost. (Some costs could ramp up over a few years, but for a broad test we might use steady-state annual amounts.)

3. **Assign Uncertainty (Standard Deviations):** Each cost comes with uncertainty – actual expenditures could be higher or lower than the estimate. Based on research:
   - Some programs have known ranges. For example, childcare \$6–12B is a wide range, reflecting uncertainty in scope and implementation. We might model this with a large standard deviation (e.g. \$2–3B) or even a skewed distribution. We could use a triangular or uniform distribution from \$6B to \$12B, or approximate it with a normal distribution (mean ~\$8B, σ ~\$2B) truncated at zero.
   - Free buses cost could vary with ridership and MTA policies. We might assign ~\$100M σ (so ~15% of \$700M) to reflect uncertainty in fare evasion or service costs.
   - Housing plan costs are highly uncertain – interest rates, construction costs, etc. We might give it, say, \$1B σ around the \$2B mean for annual city subsidy. (If interest rates rise or construction overruns, city might need to cover more; on the other hand, if private financing pitches in more, city cost could be less.)
   - Grocery stores and baby baskets are relatively small and easier to predict; maybe a $20M σ on each.
   - Smaller items (green schools, libraries) we can give a proportionate σ (maybe ~50% of mean, since these could be scaled up or down easily).
   - We will treat the revenue side as mostly fixed at ~\$10B added, but we might also introduce some uncertainty to revenue. For instance, what if the millionaire’s tax only yields \$3B instead of \$4B because some wealthy residents relocate (a concern raised by critics)? We could model the total new revenue as, say, mean \$10B with σ ~\$1B. However, to keep it simple, we might hold revenue constant at the expected level and focus on cost overruns as the primary risk.

In summary, we will create a table of policies vs. cost distributions. Each policy i will have a random cost $C_i$ drawn from a distribution (likely Normal($\mu_i$, $\sigma_i$), truncated at $0$ to avoid negatives). For regulatory policies with negligible cost, we can set $C_i \approx 0$ (or a token small cost) just for completeness.

4. **Monte Carlo Simulation:** We will use Python (with libraries like NumPy/Pandas) to run many simulations (e.g. 10,000 iterations). For each iteration:
   - Randomly sample a cost for each policy from its distribution.
   - Sum up the costs of all policies to get a total new spending required.
   - Compare the total against our budget threshold (e.g. $10B available). Record whether it’s within budget or not.

By doing this thousands of times, we get a distribution of total costs and can estimate the probability that the agenda is affordable. For example, the simulation might show something like “in 73% of scenarios, the total cost of policies is at or below \$10B, but in 27% of cases it exceeds \$10B.” This gives a sense of risk. We can also compute the expected shortfall or surplus – e.g. average amount by which costs exceed the budget in the over-budget cases.

5. **Analyze Results:** The Monte Carlo output will allow us to answer questions like:
   - What is the likelihood that Mamdani’s policies can be fully funded by the proposed $10B in new revenue?
   - Which policies contribute the most uncertainty to the budget? (We might do a sensitivity analysis by looking at the variance contribution of each component. Likely, universal childcare and housing will dominate the uncertainty, given their scale, whereas smaller programs barely move the needle.)
   - How big might a budget gap be in a worst-case scenario? For instance, if costs are at the high end (childcare \$12B, housing \$3B, etc.) and revenue is lower than expected, we could see a multi-billion dollar shortfall. The simulation can estimate a 95th percentile outcome (e.g. there’s a 5% chance that new spending could be $5B over budget, which would require either raising additional taxes, scaling back plans, or deficit – which NYC by law cannot run).
   - On the flip side, are there scenarios where costs come in under budget? If so, perhaps the city could afford even more (or run a surplus that could go to reserves).

We will present results both in summary statistics and visually (e.g. a histogram of total annual cost with the $10B budget line marked, showing the distribution of outcomes). This will illustrate the fiscal feasibility.

6. **Future Policy Scenarios:** The analysis can also be extended to look forward to future years or additional proposals. Mamdani’s first budget will focus on the above items, but looking ahead, one might wonder if he could expand these policies or add new ones (for example, further transit subsidies like free subways, more housing beyond 200k units, etc.). We can project a multi-year scenario:
   - Incorporate growth trends (e.g. costs likely rise with inflation or expanded enrollment, while revenues might grow with the economy or require further tax changes).
   - Simulate not just one year, but say a 5-year plan, where year 1 starts partial and by year 5 the programs are fully phased in. Monte Carlo can then test cumulative budget impact over the mayor’s term.
   - Include potential federal funding risks: e.g. what if a Trump administration cuts NYC grants by $X? We could model that as a negative revenue shock in the simulation to see if the city can still manage. (This wasn’t explicitly asked, but it’s part of “affording” in a broader sense of fiscal stability.)

For now, our primary goal is to use Monte Carlo simulation to account for all plausible cost variations and see if Mamdani’s agenda fits within the new funding he’s identified. Each policy gets a mean cost and standard deviation based on our research. The city’s budget threshold (around $10B new money) is the constraint. We’ll run the numbers and interpret whether the plan is fiscally realistic or if adjustments are needed.

## Conclusion

By researching Zohran Mamdani’s NYC mayoral platform, we identified his key proposals and their financial implications. We separated big spending programs from regulatory initiatives, since only the former directly draw on the city budget. Using estimates grounded in reports and expert analysis (e.g. free buses ~\$700M ￼, childcare up to ~\$10B ￼, housing \$100B over a decade ￼, etc.), we can feed these into a Monte Carlo simulation. This approach will model the uncertainty in costs and revenues to stress-test the affordability of Mamdani’s agenda.

**In summary**, Mamdani’s platform is bold but potentially achievable if his revenue hikes pass and if costs are controlled. Preliminary analyses suggest the city can do “a lot” even with existing revenues (NYC’s budget is huge and has grown steadily), and the additional ~\$10B could fund many priorities. For example, a data analysis by the Fiscal Policy Institute noted that even without new taxes, steady revenue growth in NYC funded major expansions like pre-K in the past ￼. Mamdani is effectively trying something even larger, so careful analysis is warranted. Our project will deliver that analysis – showing in detail the conditions under which his policies are affordable and where there might be fiscal gaps.

With this plan, we will proceed to implement the Monte Carlo simulation in a Jupyter notebook (using pandas, numpy, matplotlib) and report the findings, giving New Yorkers and policymakers a clearer picture of which combinations of outcomes let Mamdani’s vision succeed financially and which combinations could require course corrections ￼.
